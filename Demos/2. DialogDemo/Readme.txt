DialogDemo
==========

A standard custom dialog application.
Initialization data is transported when the dialog constructor is called.
The dialog defines a Java interface for transmitting results to the calling activity.
The activity that uses the dialog implements the interface for receiveing those results.
The dialog class implements all the listeners that result from the user interaction in the dialog layout.

See what happens when the user rotates the device with the dialog displayed.
This applicatin derives from a AppCompactActivity
